# MeteorRush
An animated shoot'em up kind of game made in my spare time. (C# / Windows Forms).

#### To note!!
I was still a newbie when it came to organising projects following a structure like MVC, and even at C# at the time of creation, though I knew how to improvise, so there's nice stuff in this beginner project as well, but expect to find loads of "less clean", sometimes inefficent code all bunched into just a few files.
